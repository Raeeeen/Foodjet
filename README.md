🍔 Foodjet – Basic Mobile Food Ordering App

📱 Overview

Foodjet is my second mobile application, inspired by platforms like Foodpanda.
It simulates a basic food ordering experience with predefined items and a layout aimed at supporting a multi-seller setup.
The app was never completed as I eventually moved on to other projects and forgot to finish it—but it still showcases early progress in mobile UI and feature planning.

✨ Features

Users can browse and "order" from a list of predefined food items.

🎯 Project Purpose

This app was built to explore the basics of e-commerce app structures and UI design, serving as a stepping stone beyond simple utilities like calculators or converters.
